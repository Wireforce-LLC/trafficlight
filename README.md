Welcome to the TrafficLight project documentation. This project aims to simulate traffic light behavior, offering a customizable approach to traffic management solutions. Here, youâ€™ll find a brief overview of the project, including specific details about the `hello.js` file.

## Overview

The TrafficLight project is designed to provide a comprehensive simulation of traffic lights, incorporating a variety of models and behaviors observed in real-world traffic management systems. It includes configuration options for different types of traffic lights, timings, and operation modes, making it a versatile tool for studying and improving traffic flow.

## hello.js

The `hello.js` file serves as the entry point to our TrafficLight project. It's responsible for initializing the project, setting up the necessary configurations, and starting the simulation. Detailed functionalities included in this file are:

- **Initialization**: Sets up the primary environment for the traffic light simulation, initializing global settings and variables.
- **Configuration**: Reads and applies the configuration settings from the project's configuration files or parameters. These settings include device models, operation timings, and device-specific options.
- **Simulation Start**: Kickstarts the traffic light simulation, engaging different models and simulation scenarios as per the configured settings.

## Components

The project is structured around several key components, detailed below:

- **_device**: Represents the physical traffic light device, containing methods and properties that simulate real-world behavior.
- **_model**: Defines the different models of traffic lights available for simulation. Each model can have its unique properties and behavior patterns.
- **_deviceHash**: A unique identifier for each simulated device, used for tracking and management purposes within the simulation environment.
- **_time**: Manages the timing aspects of the traffic light simulations, including light changes, duration of each state, and time-based events.

## Getting Started

To get started with the TrafficLight project and the `hello.js` file, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory using a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run `node hello.js` to start the simulation. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
4. Observe the simulation, and adjust configurations as needed to suit your study or project requirements.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions to the TrafficLight project. If you have suggestions, bug reports, or contributions, please submit them as pull requests or issues on our project repository.

Thank you for taking the time to explore the TrafficLight project. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued as we continue to develop and improve this simulation tool.


This JavaScript module is part of a "trafficlight" project and focuses on IP-based filtering and request handling, utilizing several external libraries and custom logic to manage and process web requests based on IP addresses and other criteria.

1. **Library Imports**: It starts by importing necessary libraries and modules:
   - `lodash` for utility functions.
   - `fs` (specifically `readFileSync`) for reading files from the filesystem.
   - `node:path` for handling file paths.
   - `mmdb-lib` for working with MaxMind DB files, such as GeoIP databases.
   - A custom configuration module (`./config`) for project-specific settings.

2. **Database Loading**: It reads a MaxMind DB file (`country_asn.mmdb`) from the current working directory, which likely contains IP geolocation or ASN (Autonomous System Number) data, into a buffer for use with `mmdb-lib`.

3. **Reader Initialization**: Initializes an `mmdb.Reader` with the loaded database for querying IP information.

4. **Tools Definition**: Defines a `TOOLS` object containing methods for IP-related checks and equality checks:
   - `IP`: Checks if an IP address (from request headers) is allowed based on country criteria specified in arguments.
   - `BOTS_APPLE_IP` and `NOT_BOTS_APPLE_IP`: Check if a request comes from an Apple IP address, returning `true`, `false`, or `undefined` based on the presence and value of the IP.
   - `EQ` and `NOT_EQ`: Check if two values are equal or not equal, respectively.

5. **Basic Filters Definition**: Defines `BASIC_FILTERS` with a single method, `APPLE_IP`, which checks if a request originates from an Apple IP address.

6. **Filter Class**: A `Filter` class is defined with methods for:
   - Combining basic filters with additional filters (e.g., negation of the `APPLE_IP` filter).
   - Formatting strings with the current working directory.
   - Recursively replacing placeholders in objects or arrays.
   - Masking an object with another object, replacing specified keys.
   - Applying named filters and tools to requests, facilitating modular and reusable request processing logic.

7. **Module Exports**: Exports the `Filter` class and the `mmdb.Reader` instance as `IPDetect` for external use.

This module is designed to provide a flexible and extensible framework for IP-based request filtering and handling, leveraging external data and custom logic to enforce access controls and process web requests according to configurable criteria.

/**
 * README.md
 *
 * This file serves as the main entry point for the TrafficLight project.
 *
 * The project consists of various modules and kits that handle routing, HTTP requests, logging, and background services.
 *
 * The project utilizes different HTTP engines based on the configuration set in the configurator.
 *
 * The main router dynamically handles routing based on the route parameter provided in the HTTP request.
 *
 * The server listens on the specified host and port, and logs each HTTP request if logging is enabled.
 *
 * Background services are started to perform tasks such as cleaning up HTTP requests with 'noindex' flags.
 *
 * The TrafficLight is ready to route traffic and can be accessed at the specified host and port.

 /**
  * `trafficlight` project - HTTP Utility Module
  *
  * This module provides a comprehensive utility for handling HTTP requests and responses within the `trafficlight` project.
  * It encapsulates common HTTP operations, such as sending positive or negative responses, setting response headers,
  * and enforcing basic authentication. This utility leverages the lodash library for some operations and integrates
  * with a custom configuration module for authentication checks.
  *
  * Dependencies:
  * - lodash: Used for utility functions like object checking and transforming.
  * - basic-auth-parser: Parses `Authorization` header for basic authentication credentials.
  * - ./config: Custom configuration module for authentication validation.
  *
  * Main Features:
  * - Generating standardized positive and negative HTTP responses.
  * - Easy manipulation of HTTP status codes and headers.
  * - Sending JSON or HTML content as responses.
  * - Support for HTTP redirection.
  * - Enforcing basic authentication with customizable realm and schema.
  * - Middleware support for basic authentication in express or similar server frameworks.
  *
  * Usage:
  * This module exports the `Http` class, which can be used directly to create instances bound to specific requests and responses,
  * or indirectly through its static methods for one-off operations. The `basicAuthMiddleware` static method provides an express middleware
  * for easy integration into web applications requiring basic authentication.
  *
  * Examples:
  * - Sending a positive JSON response:
  *   ```javascript
  *   Http.of(req, res).sendJsonObject({ message: "Success" });
  *   ```
  * - Sending a negative response with a custom status code:
  *   ```javascript
  *   Http.negative("Not Found", 404).send();
  *   ```
  * - Redirecting to another URL:
  *   ```javascript
  *   Http.of(req, res).redirect("https://example.com");
  *   ```
  * - Enforcing basic authentication:
  *   ```javascript
  *   app.use(Http.basicAuthMiddleware("mySchema"));
  *   ```
  *
  * Note:
  * This utility is designed to work within the context of the `trafficlight` project and may require adjustments
  * to be used in other projects or with different server frameworks.
